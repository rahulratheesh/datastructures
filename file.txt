Although it seems unusual to start with the following statement, the first thing we need
to produce an image is a two-dimensional surface (this surface needs to be of some
area and cannot be a point). With this in mind, we can visualize a picture as a cut made
through a pyramid whose apex is located at the center of our eye and whose height is
parallel to our line of sight (remember, in order to see something, we must view along
a line that connects to that object). We will call this cut, or slice, mentioned before, the
image plane. An image plane is a computer graphics concept and we will use it as a
two-dimensional surface to project our three-dimensional scene upon. Although it may
seem obvious, what we have just described is one of the most fundamental concepts
used to create images on a multitude of different apparatuses. For example, an
equivalent in photography is the surface of the film.
